Welcome to Informfully ([GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Informfully) & [Website](https://informfully.ch/))!
Informfully is an open-source research tool for content distribution and running user experiments.
It allows you to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history.
The benefit of Informfully, compared to other frameworks, is that it offers a complete end-to-end solution with all necessary components along the entire recommender pipeline.
Our repository offers [Datasets](https://github.com/Informfully/Datasets) for training and development purposes.
[Scrapers](https://github.com/Informfully/Scrapers) to collect items.
[Recommenders](https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders) for content curations.
And the [Informfully platform](https://github.com/Informfully/Platform) for conducting user experiments.
All components are designed to seamlessly work together.
Find out more in the [Online Documentation](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html) and create your own instance.

## Modular Research Platform

Informfully features a fully modular design.
The app/web interfaces, the content scrapers, and the recommender system can be used together or in a stand-alone fashion (see the application diagram below for an overview).
There is no dependency across these components, as they communicate exclusively via shared document collections.
Please see the online documentation for how to get started with the [app/web interfaces](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), the [content scrapers](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scrapers.html), and the [recommender system](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommenders.html).
