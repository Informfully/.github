Welcome to [Informfully](https://informfully.ch/)!
Informfully is an open-source research platform for content distribution and running user experiments. 

The platform allows you to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history.
It is a domain-agnostic and platform-independent solution to fit your specific needs.
The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability.
It features three core components: 
* a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items, 
* a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and 
* a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations to interface with third-party services.
