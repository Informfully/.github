Welcome to Informfully ([GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Informfully) & [Website](https://informfully.ch/))!
Informfully is an open-source research tool for content distribution and running user experiments.
It allows you to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history.
The benefit of Informfully, compared to other frameworks, is that it offers a complete end-to-end solution with all necessary components along the entire recommender pipeline.
