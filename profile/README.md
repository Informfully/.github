Welcome to [Informfully](https://informfully.ch/)!
It is an open-source research platform for content distribution and running user experiments.
Our platform is a visualization layer that you can add on top of your existing recommender systems.

Informfully is a domain-agnostic and platform-independent solution to fit your specific needs.
It allows you to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history.

The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability.
It features three core components: 
* a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items, 
* a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and 
* a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations to interface with third-party services.

## Informfully Research Suite

The benefit of Informfully compared to other frameworks is that it includes all components necessary along the entire recommender pipeline.
It offers [datasets](https://github.com/Informfully/Datasets) for training and development purposes.
[Scrapers](https://github.com/Informfully/Scrapers) to collect items.
[Recommenders](https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders) for content curations.
And the [Informfully platform](https://github.com/Informfully/Platform) for conducting user experiments.
All components are designed to seamlessly work together.
Find out more in the [Online Documentation](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html) and create your own instance by deploying the  [Platform Repository](https://github.com/Informfully/Platform).
